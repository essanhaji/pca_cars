# Principal component analysis Lab




### Definition
Principal component analysis is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.




### Requirements
- Python 3




### Installation
- Get the package from PyPi :
